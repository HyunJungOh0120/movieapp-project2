## 🌼 Introduction

---

This is a movie app where you can search the movie title or movie casts/credits and get some details on movie. I love netflix, but sometimes, I wanted to just see the main posters instead of auto played trailers on netflix. I love amazon prime as well, especially 'searching on watching' is the best part of it.
So I can't provide streaming service but this web app will provide the official trailers, and whatever the images we click, the search results will be displayed.

## 🚀 Features

---

There are total 4 pages.

- **Home** (/browse)

  - The webpage fetches the date on popular movies then populates the slider with a selection of movies.
  - Every 4 seconds a movie from this selection is randomly selected and displayed in the background.
  - Below the slider, 5 randomly selected genres are displayed in sliders.
  - By clicking on a movie, the user is directed to the movie's full information page.

- **Genre** (/genre)

  - In the genre section, movies are grouped and displayed based on their genre.
  - By clicking on a movie, the user is directed to the movie's full information page

- **Search** (/search)
  - The user can search a movie via the search bar in the navigation bar. Movies can be searched by title or cast member's name.
  - When the actor's name is searched, similar names will be shown. If user clicks one of these names, the website will automatically search with this name keyword.
    - ex) Daniel => Daniel Bruhl, Daniel Gillies, Daniel Baldwin, Daniel Craig...
  - If the results have same key word, the website will merge the duplicated results.
  - Provides the **infinite scroll**!

```javascript
// before
[
  { name: 'Daniel Baldwin', known_for: Array(1) },
  { name: 'Daniel Baldwin', known_for: Array(1) },
  { name: 'Daniel Baldwin', known_for: Array(2) },
][
  // after
  { name: 'Daniel Baldwin', known_for: Array(4) }
];
```

- **Detail** (/detail)
  - In the detail section, casts are displayed in slider.
  - Some recommended movies are displayed in slider as well.
  - Both casts' profile images and movies' posters will lead to search page when clicked.

## Challenging part

---

⓵ Search

- when the use search the movie title or casts, in many cases user does't write full words. In case of searching casts, all related results are listed and clickable for user to search.
- There are some duplicated results which isn't I expected. Made a for-loop function to find & merge all values into one object data.

⓶ Components

- Some re-useable components like Paginator, Button, Poster have their own css.module style. So It was quite challenging when using these on other pages especially in different sizes.

⓷ Infinite scroll

- Since TMDB api provides only 20 results in 1 page, I was considering how to load and show more results. Used Intersection Observer API, useEffect, useRef, useCallback hooks.
